## Create a Simple Mapping Application with Shiny and Leaflet

This R script was created to demonstrate how one might create a simple mapping application with the Shiny and Leaflet R packages. The intended audience has some familiarity with mapping concepts and terms (e.g. shapefiles, coordinate reference systems) and enough understanding of R to know what a 'package' is and how packages can extend R functionality.

The data sets used in this script are included in the respository. The script can be run locally after downloading the data and changing the file paths in the script. However, the intention is that interested users will use this script as a recipe to create their own applications with their own data.

Shiny applications can be published online for free by creating an account with [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/), RStudioâ€™s hosting service for Shiny apps.
